# Welcome to Patient Pending

Patient Pending is an attempt to collaboratively build a patient administration application that isn't complex to use, extend or maintain.

A secondary aim of this sample application is to further our knowledge of key software patterns and practices in a domain that we know relatively well.

Initial commit contains the basis of a light-weight CQRS 'framework' borrowing concepts from Greg Young's SimplestPossibleThing and Lokad.CQRS. It implements a very simple SQL Server event store and an example of an EventConverter for managing event versioning.

### TODO 
* Introduce Simple.Testing style event specifications
* Add a simple UI for patient management
